<!--
    This is a main page which presents all of a user's own 
        presentation statuses to that user.
    It differs depending on whether or not the user is a student
        or course staff (Head or TA).

    Heads and TAs never present, but they do listen to (and then approve
        or deny) student presentations.  They also have access to the 
        list of all of the Proof Logger users and the list of all of
        the proofs that students should present over the semester.

    Students need to work their way through presenting all of the
        proofs on the class's proofs list.  Each time a student
        presents, the student needs to submit a request to the listener
        to confirm/deny that presentation.  As presentations are
        confirmed, the student's score rises.  As students become
        qualified listeners for a proof and then listen to each other, 
        they also earn listening points.
